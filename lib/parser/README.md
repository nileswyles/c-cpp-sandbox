Policy for deciding parser strictness.
It depends but, let's define some rules to follow:
    - Does specification require it?
    - if ambiguous, prioritize as follows:
    -   strictness
    -   performance
    -   simplicity
    -   (generalize only as much as it doesn't affect performance)

-  as opposed to getting it working first? LOL, idk something to keep in mind. non-strict to strict might be part of the process. # pro-upgrades...
